FAQ
 
Q: Where is it being installed?

A: When Community leaders got together to propose a route for this separated pathway their first step was to look at abandoned rails, or along side active rails. Unfortunately, the Mid Michigan area has no usable rail lines.
The next best option was to look at federal highways. As Old US Highway 27 and US 127 both have 100ft right-of-ways (50ft on each side), this was the next obvious location for a non-motorized pathway
 
Q: Who will use the Pathway?

A: This pathway will be utilized by; bicyclists, walkers, runners, handicap users, and rollerbladers in the warmer months with cross country skiers utilizing the pathway in the winter months. Families, individuals, young and old will all have access to this trail for recreation and comminuting needs. By incorporating art in this pathway it will also be an economic draw for tourism to our area.
 
Q: What about Crime and Vandalism?

Q: What about Liability and insurance?

Q: What is it made of?
 
A: Ideally this trail will be a separated non-motorized paved pathway. The pathway will be a 10ft wide paved pathway, with 2ft of crushed gravel on either side of the trail.
