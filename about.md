About Us
  
The Mid Michigan Community Pathways Group is made up of community leaders to develop a non-motorized pathway connecting the Pere-Marquette Trail with the Fred Meijer Trail through the communities of Clare, Rosebush, Mt. Pleasant, Shepherd, Alma, St. Louis and Ithaca. This pathway will be utilized by: bicyclists, walkers, runners, handicap users, and rollerbladers in the warmer months, with cross country skiers utilizing the pathway in the winter months. Families, individuals, young and old will all have access to this trail for recreation and comminuting needs. 
The proposed pathway will encompass the existing wildlife and natural surroundings disrupting as little as possible. It has also been proposed to add art installations and native landscaping to add to the beauty of this pathway.
The proposed route will include Clare, Rosebush, Mt. Pleasant, Shepherd, Alma, St Louis, and Ithaca.
